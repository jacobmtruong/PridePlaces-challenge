//Start by logging into or creating a replit account
//Then fork this replit into you own account

//We would like you to create a form input with a submit button
//that allows a user to type strings and save them to an array.
//That array of strings should be rendered to the screen in a list.
//each press of the submit button adds another string to the list, and thus, the screen.
//Good Luck!
